*OS X only for now, but will expand when further along.*


## Install

[Download](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-app/releases) the app, unzip, and move it to the `Applications` folder.

*Devtools is opened with the app to make it easier to debug issues. Feel free to close it.*

Feedback wanted :)
